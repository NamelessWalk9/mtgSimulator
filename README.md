This application is by no means mathematically perfect and definitely has its faults. 
This is not intended to give you the mathematically correct amount of lands in your deck, just a suggestion based off the amount of lands other people are running
with similar average cmc costs.
The suggested lands also does not take into account the 'type' of deck you are playing, only the converted mana cost of the deck, so obviously if you're playing
a landfall deck and your average cmc is around 3(hypothetical), you're still going to want ~38+ lands.
The data for the decks is also very small as of right now, so the lands suggestions may be a bit wonk, but there is an option to add your own deck data, so
if you feel like helping out you can add your own deck data to help give better suggestions!
The simulation aspect of this application is to help show you the rough percantage of games that you could get mana screwed/flooded to help better deckbuilding.
The simulation only takes into account Land, Nonland, and Ramp cards. It also asks how many cards you expect to draw by turn 4. 
The simulation only accounts for turns 0-4, and checks if you have ~4 mana(at least) by turn 4. It also takes into account mulligans(but not newer mulligan rule
allowing you to draw 7 and place required amount on bottom of library) to a minimum of 4 cards.
